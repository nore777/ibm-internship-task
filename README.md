# IBM internship task
This is a React and Node.js application developed in TypeScript specifically for the internship task assigned by IBM.

## Setup
To test out this application locally you'll need to run the React client and Node.js server separately like so:
```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/nore777/ibm-internship-task .

# start backend
cd backend
npm i
```
Now you'll need to copy the .env.example file to .env.dev file inside the backend directory.
Make sure you have access to an MongoDB Uri, either install it on your machine or get storage on their website
which they give for testing purposes. Type in said URI and run the backend with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

To run the client go to the frontend directory and type:
```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

Now you're set to test the app!
